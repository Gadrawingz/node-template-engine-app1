# NODE-EXPRESS DOJO - TEMPLATE ENGINE

## WHAT IS TEMPLATE ENGINE?
A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine 
replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. 
This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page.
